Dear Participant,


In the following experiment we will show you animated icons depicting paths of cannon balls leaving craters in relation to a city.

Your task is to sort the animated icons that we will present you with on the left side of the screen into groups on the right. Please sort them based on how similar they are. You can create as many groups as you think are appropriate. Just use the button NEW GROUP to create more groups. Drag items into groups by holding down the left mouse button. You may delete a group by using the DELETE button. All icons within that group will be placed on the left side again. You can also sort icons directly from one category into another.

You decide which items belong together. There is no right or wrong group for the animated icons. This task should take 20-30 minutes and you should do it in one sitting. Your first task is completed when all animated icons from the left side have been placed into groups on the right side. If you have further questions please ask the experimenter. We have prepared a short example to acquaint you with the interface. When you have sorted all icons, press FINISH.

Please press OK.
